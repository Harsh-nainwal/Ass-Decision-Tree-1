    "Q1. Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "A Decision Tree is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm that works by recursively dividing the data into subsets based on the values of input features. Here's how it works to make predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Tree Building: The algorithm starts with the entire dataset and selects the best feature to split the data. It does this by measuring how well each feature separates the classes using metrics like Gini impurity or entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Splitting: The chosen feature is used to split the dataset into two or more subsets. Each subset represents a branch or node in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Recursion: The splitting process is then applied to each subset, creating a tree structure. The algorithm keeps splitting the data until a stopping condition is met, such as reaching a maximum depth or having a minimum number of samples in a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Leaf Nodes: At the end of the process, the subsets become smaller and eventually become leaf nodes. Each leaf node is associated with a class label.\n",
    "Q2. Mathematical Intuition of Decision Tree Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical intuition behind decision trees involves finding the best feature and threshold to split the data. This is done by minimizing a measure of impurity, such as Gini impurity or entropy. These measures assess how mixed or pure the classes are in a given subset of data. The goal is to find splits that lead to the purest subsets, making classification more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Using Decision Tree for Binary Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree classifier can be used to solve a binary classification problem by creating a tree structure with two branches at each nodeâ€”one for each class. At each step, the algorithm selects the best feature and threshold to split the data, aiming to minimize impurity. This process continues until the tree is fully grown. To make a prediction for a new data point, it traverses the tree from the root to a leaf node, following the selected feature thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Geometric Intuition of Decision Tree Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically, decision trees divide the feature space into regions or rectangles. Each decision boundary corresponds to a threshold on one of the features. When you traverse down the tree, you're moving across these decision boundaries, and at the end, you end up in a leaf node corresponding to a class prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A confusion matrix is a table that shows how a classification model's predictions compare to the actual labels. It contains four values: True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Precision, Recall, and F1 Score from Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have a confusion matrix like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "             Predicted Positive   Predicted Negative\n",
    "Actual Positive       TP                  FN\n",
    "Actual Negative       FP                  TN\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision: TP / (TP + FP)\n",
    "Recall : TP / (TP + FN)\n",
    "F1 Score: 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Importance of Choosing Evaluation Metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing an appropriate evaluation metric is crucial because it aligns with the problem's goals. For example, in a medical diagnosis task, recall might be more important to catch all positive cases (even with some false positives). In fraud detection, precision could be critical to avoid false alarms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Precision as Most Important Metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Email Spam Detection\n",
    "In this case, you want to avoid classifying legitimate emails as spam (minimize false positives). High precision ensures that when the model predicts \"spam,\" it's highly likely to be spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Q9. Recall as Most Important Metric:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Disease Detection\n",
    "In medical diagnoses, missing a positive case (false negative) can have severe consequences. High recall helps ensure that most cases of the disease are caught, even if it means some false positives."
